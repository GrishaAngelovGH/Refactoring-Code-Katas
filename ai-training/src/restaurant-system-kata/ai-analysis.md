Your refactored code effectively separates concerns, improves modularity, and enhances readability. Let’s analyze the design choices and their impact:

### **Strengths of Refactored Code**
1. **Modular and Reusable Helper Functions**:
   - Functions like `validateItem`, `checkConfirmedReservation`, and `calculateOrderTotal` encapsulate specific pieces of logic. This makes your code more reusable and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
   - **Advantage**: If similar logic is required elsewhere, you can easily reuse these functions.

2. **Improved Readability**:
   - Class methods (e.g., `addMenuItem`, `makeReservation`, `placeOrder`) are concise and focus on high-level orchestration. Details are delegated to helper functions.
   - **Advantage**: The system is easier to understand and maintain because operations are broken down logically.

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Validation logic (`validateReservation`, `validateItem`), reservation management (`createNewReservation`, `markAsConfirmed`), and order handling (`calculateOrderTotal`, `getOrderByCustomerName`) are distinct.
   - **Advantage**: Each operation is self-contained, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Helper functions like `getReservationBy` and `checkConfirmedReservation` provide detailed error messages, ensuring that operations fail gracefully when preconditions aren't met.
   - **Advantage**: Makes debugging easier by providing clear feedback.

5. **Encapsulation of Logic**:
   - Functions like `calculateOrderTotal` abstract the logic of summing up menu prices, while `markAsConfirmed` handles reservation status changes.
   - **Advantage**: High-level methods in the class remain uncluttered.

### **Summary**
Your refactored `RestaurantSystem` demonstrates an excellent balance between modularity, clarity, and separation of concerns. With a few refinements—like grouping helpers, using private methods, or introducing custom error classes—you can further enhance scalability and maintainability.
